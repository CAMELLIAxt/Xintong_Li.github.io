# **Xintong** Li

Hi👋! I’m **Xintong Li (李欣桐)**. I'm an undergraduate student in the **Honors Talent Program in Statistics and Data Science** at **Renmin University of China**
I'm very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [<span style="color:#AE0B2A;">Xiao Zhou</span>](https://xiaozhoucam.github.io/) at the LUMOS AI Lab. 
I also have the incredible opportunity to work with fantastic mentors at Rutgers University. At the [<span style="color:#AE0B2A;">ARSENAL Lab</span>](https://people.cs.rutgers.edu/~dz220/Group.html), I'm co-advised by Prof. [<span style="color:#AE0B2A;">Desheng Zhang</span>](https://people.cs.rutgers.edu/~dz220/), Prof. [<span style="color:#AE0B2A;">Guang Wang</span>](https://guangwang.me/), and Prof. [<span style="color:#AE0B2A;">Zhiqing Hong</span>](http://www.zhiqinghong.one/). Additionally, I collaborate with Prof. [<span style="color:#AE0B2A;">Yifan Hu</span>](https://sites.google.com/view/yifan-hu) from the Department of Statistics.


My research interests mainly lie in the intersection of **Human–AI Collaboration**, **Causal Inference and Discovery**, **Spatio-temporal Modeling**, and **AI for Social Good**. I am excited about building theoretically grounded frameworks that work robustly in complex, real-world environments.

I am actively seeking **Ph.D. or Master's opportunities for Fall 2026** and am eager to connect with fellow researchers and potential advisors!


### Publications 📚
<br>
<span style="font-size:smaller;">\* denotes co-first authorship.</span>

*   **Spatio-Temporal Hierarchical Causal Models** [<span style="color:#AE0B2A;">PDF</span>](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20558) [<span style="color:#AE0B2A;">Code</span>](https://github.com/CAMELLIAxt/ST-HCMs)  
    **<u>Xintong Li</u>**, Haoran Zhang, and Xiao Zhou.  
    *In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence **(AAAI 2026)**.*

    ▶ **TL;DR:** We introduce Spatio-Temporal Hierarchical Causal Models (ST-HCMs) to perform causal inference from spatio-temporal data with unobserved, time-invariant confounders, a setting where traditional methods fail.

*   **AtC: Aggregate-then-Calibrate for Human-centered Assessment** [<span style="color:#AE0B2A;">PDF</span>](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=XNbVoi9mfr) [<span style="color:#AE0B2A;">Code</span>](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/12500\_AtC\_supp-4F50)  
    Zejun Xie\*, **<u>Xintong Li</u>**\*, Guang Wang, and Desheng Zhang.  
    *Submitted to **ICLR 2026**. (under review)*
    
    ▶ **TL;DR:** AtC aggregates human comparisons into a consensus and isotonic-calibrates any model’s scores via the consensus, delivering decision-ready assessments with guarantees on efficiency, robustness, and optimality.

*   **FAP-CD: Fairness-Driven Age-Friendly Community Planning via Conditional Diffusion Generation** [<span style="color:#AE0B2A;">PDF</span>](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/35036) [<span style="color:#AE0B2A;">Code</span>](https://github.com/jinlin2021/FAP\_CD) [<span style="color:#AE0B2A;">Poster</span>](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iUbyskqRom4EU77O5kA\_vHO2M90ZzaOD/view?usp=sharing)  
    Jinlin Li, **<u>Xintong Li</u>**, and Xiao Zhou.  
    *In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2025).* (Poster)

    ▶ **TL;DR:** FAP-CD utilizes a conditioned graph denoising diffusion probabilistic model to learn the conditional joint probability distribution of aging facilities and their spatial relationships, and generates optimized spatial distributions of facilities.
